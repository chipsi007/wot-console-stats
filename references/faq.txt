How were WN8  and percentiles calculated?

The data of around 50,000 random WoT Console profiles was collected. To be a piece of valid data, a player must have had at least 2500 battles on the account. Then ratios were calculated for each tank of every player. To be included in the final rating, Tier 6+ vehicles had to have more than 100 battles, 20 battles for Tier 3+ and 10 battles for Tier 4-. After assembling all player ratios, the percentiles for each tank were calculated using a math module. More information about percentile can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile">Wikipedia</a>.
As about WN8, the same data was used to find median values for each expected WN8 number. Then values were scaled up so the distribution curve matches the current one as <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IDDT/wot-console-playerbase-analysis/master/wn8_results/avg80-70comparison.png">shown here</a>. (blue for WN8 PC, red for Consoles)

What exactly do all these selectors in the tanks' table mean?

WinRate: Winning battles/total number of battles.
Battles: Total battles on the account.

Avg Damage: Average damage dealt per battle.
Avg Frags: Average number of frags per battle.
Avg EXP: Average experience per battle.
Avg DPM: The actual Damage Per Minute that player achieved on the tank.
Avg FPM: Average frags per minute.
Avg EPM: Average experience per minute.
Dmg Percentile: Shows the percent of players that have lower average damage per battle number.
WR Percentile: Shows the percent of players that have a lower average winning rate.
Exp Percentile: Shows the percent of players that have lower average experience per battle.
Penetrated/Hits caused: Percentage of player\'s penetrating hits out of all hits, excluding misses.
Bounced/Hits received: Percent of all non-damage hits that hit the player.
HE hits/Hits received: Percent of how many of all shells were High Explosives that hit the player.
Total Lifetime: Total number of minutes spent driving the tank. ***
Average Lifetime: Average lifetime. ***
Last battle time: How many (min, h, d, m, y) ago the tank was driven.
*** Only the time between the actual start of the battle (15:00 on a battle timer) and player death is included.

How long does the website keep the data?

So far it is 8 days, so there will be enough data to show daily changes for the last 7 days.

Something doesn't seem to work properly and I feel helpful.
